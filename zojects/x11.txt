in this text file we will go through the x11 documentation.


** OBSERVATIONS

THERE ARE MANY TOOLKITS FOR X : GTK, QT, CLUTTER and many more.

for low level x development 

THE 

	X	C	B

	X11	C		BINDINGS


provide a clean low level protocol binding. it's older version is called XLIB and is quite almost deprecated however it still hasn't kicked the bucket due to its still wide usage. Furthermore, a similarly deprecated library is the XT library.



*******************
THE X WINDOW SYSTEM


X IS AN ARCHITECTURE-INDEPENDENT SYSTEM FOR REMOTE GUIS AND INPUT DEVICE CAPABILITIES. EACH USER USING A NETWORKED TERMINAL HAS THE ABILITY TO INTERACT WITH THE DISPLAY WITH ANY TYPE OF USER DEVICE.

  --------
X PROVIDES A PRIMITIVE FRAMEWORK, FOR BUILDING SUCH GUI ENVIRONMENTS: DRAWING AND MOVING WINDOWS ON THE DISPLAY.

ONE KEY THING TO NOTE IS THAT X DOES NOT MANDATE THE EXISTENCE OF USER INTERFACES; PRGORAMS MAY USE ITS GRAPHICAL CAPABILITIES WITHOUTTHERE EVER BEING THE EXISTENCE OF USER INTERFACES.

UNLIKE PREVIOUS EARLIER PROTOCOLS X WAS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO BE USED OVER NETWORK CONNECTIONS INSTEAD OF RELYING ON AN INTEGRAL OR ATTACHED DISPLAY DEVICE. X FEATURES NETWORK TRANSPARENCY WHICH MEANS THAT AN X PROGRAM RUNNING ON A COMPUTER SOMEWHERE ON A NETWORK (SUCH AS THE INTERNET) CAN DISPLAY ITS USER INTERFACE ON AN X SERVER RUNNING ON SOME OTHER COMPUTER ON THE NETWORK.


SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE --:


X USES A CLIENT-SERVER MODEL: AN X SERVER COMMUNICATES WITH VARIOSU CLIENT PROGRAMS. THE SERVER ACCEPTS REQUESTS FOR GRAPHICAL OUTPUT (WINDOWS) AND SENDS BACK USER INPUT (FROM KEYBOARD, MOUSE OR TOUCHSCREEN). THE SERVER MAY FUNCTION AS : 

** AN APPLICATION DISPLAYING TO A WINDOW OF ANOTHER DISPLAY SYSTEM

** A SYSTEM PROGRAM CONTROLLING THE VIDEO OUTPUT OF A PC

** A DEDICATED PIECE OF SOFTWARE


SO INSIDE OF THE USER'S WORKSTATIONS :

THE INPUT DEVICES INTERACT WITH THE X SERVER THROUGH THE OPERATING SYSTEM KERNEL AND DRIVERS AND THE X SERVER FURTHER RELAYS THE INFORMATION ON TO THE X CLIENTS WHICH ARE THE APPLICATIONS THAT ARE RUNNING ON THE X SERVER, AND, IF THERE EXISTS A FURTHER REMOTE MACHINE: THE USER INTERFACE WILL BE RELAYED EVEN FUTHER ON TO THE REMOTE MACHINE'S SCREEN.

and that is how the x graphical protocol works.
